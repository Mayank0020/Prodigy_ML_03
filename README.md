# Support Vector Machine(SVM) to classify between Cats vs. Dogs

## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Support vector Machine model to classify the images based on whether it is a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a dataset and can be used to classify between dogs and cats.

## Contents

The repository contains the following file:-

1.  task3.ipynb : A jupyter notebook including the code of the Linear Regression Model
2.  requirements.txt : A text file containing the libraries used to create this project

## Getting Started :-

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required python libraries from requirments.txt
3. Open the task3.ipynb on your system and run the file

## Results :-

The perfomance of this model is based on the accuracy score of the model generated after fitting the data to the model. After that the images are inputted to the model to predict the image.

## Contributing :-

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknoledgment :-

- The dataset was obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- This project was inspired by various online tutorials and courses on machine learning and data science.
